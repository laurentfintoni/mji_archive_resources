# Music Archives & Historical Resources
A website that catalogs archives, historical, and research resources that deal with music in some way. It is intended as something that music journalists, academics, musicians, fans, and anyone curious about music might find useful.

See the [about page](https://studies.laurentfintoni.com/mji/about/) for more information on the project.
