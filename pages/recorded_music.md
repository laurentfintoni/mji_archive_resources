The categories used to arrange the resources in this website are imperfect and intended only as a guide. Resources are classified under the category that seems most relevant to them based on content, though many focus on more than one subject. 

This category is intended to cover resources that deal with music in the context of our relationship to it as something that can be recorded, shared, and consumed regardless of genre. Information about the genre focus, if any, is included in each record.
