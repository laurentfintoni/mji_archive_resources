The categories used to arrange the resources in this website are imperfect and intended only as a guide. Resources are classified under the category that seems most relevant to them based on content, though many focus on more than one subject. 

Popular music is intended primarily in its Western, and for now North American, context and covers resources that deal with music forms and expressions that became popular over the 19th and 20th centuries and often form the basis of ongoing forms of popular music today.
