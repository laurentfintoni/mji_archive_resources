The categories used to arrange the resources in this website are imperfect and intended only as a guide. Resources are classified under the category that seems most relevant to them based on content, though many focus on more than one subject. 

This category is intended to cover resources that relate to punk, hardcore, and metal as specific expressions of the wider rock & roll form.
