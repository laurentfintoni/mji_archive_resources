desription: 'The papers of reporter, photographer, and publisher, Sam Kindrick, span
  1934-2018, and are arranged into three series: Photographs, Kindrick’s Personal
  Papers, and Action Magazine. The bulk of the collection relates to Action Magazine,
  a monthly newspaper Kindrick launched in 1975 and which was key in its documentation
  of the San Antonio and Texas redneck rock and country scene. Included are approximately
  4,000 photographs from the publication, and a near-complete run of the paper. Kindrick’s
  personal papers also include copies of his column from the San Antonio Express News,
  1968-1974.'
