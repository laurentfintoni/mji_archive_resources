desription: Coda Magazine was a bi-monthly Canadian music magazine published from
  1958 through 2009. Coda included interviews, feature articles, reviews, and news
  both focused on jazz in Canada as well as the international growth of the genre.
  An archive of over 200 issues from 1973 to 2008 was initially available via the
  Internet Archive but was empty as of 2023. The IA collection currently points to
  an official website which includes part of the archive in text format.
