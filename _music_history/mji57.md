desription: Manchester Digital Music Archive is an online community archive established
  in 2003 to celebrate Greater Manchester music and its social history. Its crowd-sourced
  archive and website is a place for people all over the world to share Manchester
  music ephemera and memories, be they fans, musicians or involved with the music
  industry itself. The project believes that through crowd-sourcing artefacts they
  can democratise heritage and provide a platform for multiple versions of history
  to be shared. There is no hierarchy of 'merit' within the archive. The general public
  decides what is important and what is 'heritage'.
