desription: 'Womxn Who Rock brings together scholars, musicians, media-makers, performers,
  artists, and activists to explore the role of women and popular music in the creation
  of cultural scenes and social justice movements in the Americas and beyond. This
  multifaceted endeavor reshapes conventional understandings of music and cultural
  production by initiating collective methods of research, teaching, and community
  and scholarly collaboration. The project encompasses several interwoven components:
  an annual participant-driven, community engagement conference and film festival;
  project-based coursework at the graduate and undergraduate levels; and an oral history
  archive that ties the various components together.'
