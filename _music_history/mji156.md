desription: Author and historian Lynn Abbott conducted interviews from 1981 through
  1995 documenting the Black acapella gospel quartet singing tradition in New Orleans,
  Alabama, and Mississippi from the 1920s. Interviewees include local New Orleans
  and regional gospel singers, performers, ensembles, vocal coaches and educators,
  several who are also reverends. Interviewees describe the development of their gospel
  sounds, styles, influences, performances, and formations of quartets. Several interviews
  spotlight the evolution of gospel quartets and their popularity while touring and
  recording, including the shift from acapella singing to a "modern quartet" with
  electric guitar, bass, and drum accompaniment.
