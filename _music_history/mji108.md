desription: The Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound of The New York
  Public Library is one of the richest resources of recorded sound in the world. The
  Archives' holdings cover virtually every aspect of recorded sound—from Mozart to
  Maria Callas to Motown, from symphonic works to presidential speeches, from radio
  dramas to television specials. A vital research facility for performers, musicians,
  scholars, critics, and the recording industry, the collection also plays a leadership
  role in developing technology that allows for the transfer of sound from obsolete
  to accessible formats. The Archives contains approximately 700,000 recordings and
  more than 100,000 printed items. Resources—available for study free of charge.
