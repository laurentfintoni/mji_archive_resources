desription: The Timeline of African American Music represents decades of scholarship
  conducted and led by Dr. Portia K. Maultsby, a pioneer in the study of African American
  music, as well as the contributions of numerous scholars. From the earliest folk
  traditions to present-day popular music, the timeline is a detailed view of the
  evolution of African American musical genres that span the past 400 years. This
  celebration of African American musical traditions reveals the unique characteristics
  of each genre and style, while also offering in-depth studies of pioneering musicians
  who created some of Americaâ€™s most timeless artistic expressions. This interactive
  version of the timeline, hosted by Carnegie Hall, came about in the early 10s as
  an online education tool and has since been updated through grants to include multimedia
  stories, recordings, and images from the Rose Archives. The timeline also includes
  studies of events that have taken place at Carnegie Hall over the past 130 years.
