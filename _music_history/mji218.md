desription: The East Village Eye was a monthly magazine dedicated to popular and avant-garde
  culture that ran from May 1979 to January 1987. Focused on the scenes emerging out
  of New York City, and in particular the East Village, the Eye included coverage
  of musical movements such as hip-hop and punk as well as visual arts, clubs and
  performance spaces, and fashion. Many artists and writers created pieces or wrote
  for the magazine, helping spread its notoriety both nationally and internationally.
  Following the acquisition of the magazineâ€™s archives by the New York Public Library,
  all issues were made available for browsing via a dedicated website.
