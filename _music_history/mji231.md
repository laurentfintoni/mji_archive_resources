desription: The Great 78 Project is a community project for the preservation, research
  and discovery of 78rpm records. From about 1898 to the 50s, an estimated 3 million
  sides (~3 minute recordings) have been made on 78rpm discs. While the commercially
  viable recordings will have been restored or remastered onto LP or CD, there is
  still research value in the artifacts and usage evidence in the often rare 78rpm
  discs and recordings. Already, over 20 collections have been selected by the Internet
  Archive for physical and digital preservation and access. Started by many volunteer
  collectors, these new collections have been selected, digitized and preserved by
  the Internet Archive,  George Blood LP, and the Archive of Contemporary Music. Currently
  the project includes over 400,000 recordings.
