desription: Academic research project focused on analysing large-scale data for melodic
  patterns in jazz performances, led by musicologists and computer scientists from
  the UK, USA, France, and Germany. Using jazz recordings as the basis for a corpus
  of data, the project sought to “develop innovative technological and music-analytical
  methods to gain fresh insight into jazz history.” The two primary results are a
  paper about licks in the literature of jazz research, a web interface for pattern
  search, and a pattern history explorer app (both based on a dataset of Weimar jazz).
