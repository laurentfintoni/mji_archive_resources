desription: Vibe Magazine is a music and entertainment publication focused on R&B,
  hip-hop, and Black culture. It was founded in 1993 by music producers Quincy Jones
  and David Salzman and was published in print until 2014. Vibe’s brand expanded beyond
  the traditional features, reviews, and interviews into its own award show, Best
  Rapper Alive Tournament, and special editions like Vibe Vixen which focused on beauty,
  fashion, and other traditional women’s magazine content. An archive of print issues
  published from 1993 to 2008 was originally available via Google Books but as of
  June 2022 is no longer included in that library. Currently only the Internet Archive
  still offers a mirror containing 70 issues from that period.
