desription: The Radio Télévision Guinée (RTG) sound archive in Conakry, Guinea, was
  archived and digitized between 2008 and 2013 by Radio Africa’s Graeme Counsel. The
  physical archive consisted of thousands of audio reels on 1/4" magnetic tape, u-Matic
  videos and 24mm film which have been catalogued and are available online via the
  British Library’s Sound And Moving Image Catalogue. The physical collection is also
  available at the Bibliothèque National de Guinée in Conakry. 9,410 songs were archived,
  spanning the years from 1960 to 2000, with the bulk recorded between 1967 to 1984
  at the height of Guinea's Cultural Revolution. This website documents the archival
  process and includes catalogue and discographies.
