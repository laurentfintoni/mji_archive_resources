desription: The Arhoolie Foundation stems from the work of founder Chris Strachwitz
  and the namesake independent record label, focused on recording and sharing regional
  music with a special emphasis on the genres of Blues, Cajun/Zydeco, and Tejano/Norteño.
  In 2016, Smithsonian Folkways acquired Arhoolie Records and continues to distribute
  the Arhoolie catalog worldwide. The foundation’s archival website includes photo
  galleries, interviews, videos, and streaming audio.
