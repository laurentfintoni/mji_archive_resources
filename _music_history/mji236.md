desription: A collection of mixtapes from datpiff.com, which became a central source
  for hip-hop and rap mixtapes between 2005 and the early 2020s. The site shuttered
  in 2023, moving to a brand focus, and announced a partnership with the Internet
  Archive to preserve as much of the music it hosted as possible. As of December 2023,
  the IA collection page includes over 66,000 items.
