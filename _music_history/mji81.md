desription: Published from 1973 to 1982, Rock Scene documented the rise of glam and
  punk rock. The magazine acted as a sort of hybrid between fanzine and tabloid. Rock
  Sceneâ€™s content was known for featuring backstage and after party photos among tour
  scrapbooks, interviews, and cover stars like David Bowie, KISS, Aerosmith, Elton
  John, and The New York Dolls. All issues of Rock Scene in this archive were originally
  available via a Flash plugin and are now included in a single, searchable PDF file.
