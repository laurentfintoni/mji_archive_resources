desription: 'Hispano Music and Culture of the Northern Rio Grande: The Juan B. Rael
  Collection is an online presentation of an ethnographic field collection documenting
  religious and secular music of Spanish-speaking residents of rural Northern New
  Mexico and Southern Colorado. In 1940, Juan Bautista Rael of Stanford University,
  a native of Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico, used disc recording equipment supplied by
  the Archive of American Folk Song (American Folklife Center archive) to document
  alabados (hymns), folk drama, wedding songs, and dance tunes. The recordings included
  in the collection were made in Alamosa, Manassa, and Antonito, Colorado, and in
  Cerro and Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico. In addition to these recordings, the collection
  includes manuscript materials and publications authored by Rael which provide insight
  into the rich musical heritage and cultural traditions of this region.'
