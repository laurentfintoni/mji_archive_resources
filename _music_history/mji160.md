desription: This project stands for the redistribution of high-quality live music
  videos in as much of an anti-capitalist framework as realistically allowable. At
  its crux, music is the communication of ideas through rhythm and sound. The introduction
  of money into the equation invariably obscures that connection. In an era when the
  turnover rate in the community is staggeringly high, this site serves as a vehicle
  for preservation and posterity. Institutional memory is key in any setting, and
  hardcore is no exception. A band's live performance tells a story about a particular
  moment in time relative to a particular audience. The intention here is to share
  that story with people who could not be there to experience it, both physically
  and temporally, or with those who have no conception of what hardcore is. The website
  features a database of 100s of videos searchable by band, venue, or city.
