  Canadian Folk Music / Musique folklorique canadienne is an academic magazine published by The Canadian Society for Traditional Music. The aim is to promote the study and promotion of the traditional music of Canada, reflecting both ethnomusicologist and consumer perspectives.
  This archive is split into two sections following a renaming and push to move online. The first 33 issues of this publication are available through the Canadian Folk Music Bulletin (CFMB). The remaining archives up to 2016 are available on the Canadian Folk Music website.
