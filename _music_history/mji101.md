desription: Punk Planet was a punk zine based out of Chicago, Illinois running from
  1994 to 2007. Punk Planet covered exclusively independently released albums in characteristically
  lengthy reviews sections alongside interviews and articles concerning media criticism,
  labor issues, and feminism. Punk Planet approached their coverage through the lens
  of punk as a greater subculture rather than merely a youth centered genre of music,
  an approach that shows in their commitment to a broad range of independent arts
  and interviews typically concerned with the intentions of the artist. The Punk Planet
  archive contains full color scans of all 80 issues of the zine.
