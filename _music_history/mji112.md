desription: The Louisville Underground Music Archive (LUMA) Project began as a concerted
  effort in early 2013 to address the gap in the historical record related to independent/underground
  rock music culture in Louisville. The LUMA Project collects oral histories, show
  recordings, set lists, photographs, zines, posters, flyers, t-shirts, ephemera,
  correspondence, business records, and early web history related to the local rock/punk/indie/hardcore
  music scene. The LUMA digital collection consists of selected items from the LUMA
  Project. Starting with a full run (31 issues) of The Official Burt the Cat Fanclub
  Newsletter, items with clear copyright may be digitized and added to the LUMA digital
  collection as resources allow.
