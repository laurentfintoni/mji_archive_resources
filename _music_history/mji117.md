desription: "#312Soul began as a month-long exploration of Chicago’s Black music history
  from 1955 to 1990. Curated by O’Keefe Reinhard & Paul and Vince Lawrence, it’s now
  an ongoing project. The project explores the years 1955 to 1990 and the songs and
  sounds that emanated from Chicago’s Southside. From the gospel-influenced Soul of
  late 50s and early 60s to the message songs of Curtis Mayfield and Cur-Tom Records;
  the powerful and ubiquitous “Horn Sound of Chicago” to the birth of the now global
  phenomenon known as House, the project presents untold stories and unsung stars
  who lived through each exciting era."
