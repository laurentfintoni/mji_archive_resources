desription: 'The IUMA was started in 1993 by three students at the University of California
  at Santa Cruz: Jeff Patterson, Jon Luini and Rob Lord. The three men worked together
  to create an online music archive that would help musicians and bands who weren''t
  signed by a major label. The site allowed these unsigned artists to upload files
  and send them to fans. The site also gave the artists the opportunity to talk with
  their fans. The IUMA was at first part of the Usenet newsgroups and eventually became
  part of eMusic and was shut down in 2006. Parts of the collection are now preserved
  by the Internet Archive.'
