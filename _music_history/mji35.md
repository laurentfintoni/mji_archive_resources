desription: In 2016, University Archives & Special Collections in the Joseph P. Healey
  Library at UMass Boston launched the Massachusetts Hip-Hop Archive with an initial
  donation by Pacey Foster of recordings from the Lecco’s Lemma radio program, a local
  rap music show that was founded by Magnus Johnstone and ran from 1985 to 1988 on
  local college radio stations WMBR (88.1 FM) and WZBC (90.3 FM). This digital collections
  includes The Lecco’s Lemma Collection, which contains both artist demos that were
  given to Magnus, as well as recordings of the show made by Willie “Loco” Alexander,
  who regularly taped the show throughout its run, and The Tony Rose and Yvonne Rose
  Collection, which currently contains a recording of a locally-produced show, Dance
  Slam, from 1989.
