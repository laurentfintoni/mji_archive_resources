desription: The Archive of North Indian Classical Music (ANICM) was set up at the
  School of Cultural Texts and Records, Jadavpur University, in early 2004 by Prof.
  Amlan Das Gupta. The work has been funded by two successive Major Project Grants
  from the Endangered Archives Programme of the British Library along with funding
  under the Documentation of Rare Texts Programme instituted by the University Grants
  Commission (UGC). Over the last 15 years, the archive has grown substantially, and
  at present contains about 8,000 plus hours of recorded music in digital form as
  well as a substantial corpus of music on loan, awaiting digitization. The archive
  houses music recorded commercially as well as covers and private recordings more
  than a hundred years old. It is thus one of the largest repositories of Hindustani
  classical music in the country, especially rich in the genres of traditional music
  available across a large variety of carriersâ€”from wax-cylinders, 78 rpm records
  to reel-to-reel magnetic spool tapes etc.
