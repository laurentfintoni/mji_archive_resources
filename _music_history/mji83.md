desription: Bizz Magazine was a Brazilian music magazine started in 1985 following
  the dissolution of Brazilâ€™s military dictatorship. Seeing an explosion of youth
  culture at the first Rock In Rio festival and a desire among that youth to learn
  about music, the magazine focused on coverage tailored to rock of the time both
  in Brazil and abroad. At the time of writing, this archive features digitized copies
  of a majority of the 192 issues alongside special editions with more narrow coverage.
