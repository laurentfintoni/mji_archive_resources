desription: While best known today as a music label dedicated to electronic music,
  Hyperdub originally began life in 2000 as an online magazine run and edited by Steve
  Goodman, aka Kode9, and featuring writing from Goodman, Kodwo Eshun, Martin Clark
  and others about the various mutations of dance music at the turn of the century.
  The magazine disappeared in 2004 when the label was launched. This is a partial,
  unofficial archive of the magazine. Originally maintained by riddim.ca, it is now
  only available via the Wayback Machine.
