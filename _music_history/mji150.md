desription: Latin American electroacoustic music has a long, interesting, strong and
  prolific history, but itâ€™s a history that is little known even within the region
  itself. Many composers born or living in Latin America have been very active in
  this field, going back as far as some 50 years in some countries, but the availability
  of electroacoustic music recordings and information in Latin America has been a
  problem for educators, composers, performers, researchers, students and the general
  public. This archive has been developed as a response to this problem and includes
  historical context, over 500 compositions, biographies, interviews, and graphic
  materials.
