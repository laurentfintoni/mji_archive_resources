desription: 'Dr. Samuel A. Floyd, Jr. established the Black Music Research Newsletter
  in 1977 while at the Project for Research in Black American Music at Southern Illinois
  University - Carbondale, Illinois, where it was published until summer 1978. The
  newsletter promoted and encouraged scholarship and culture in Black American music
  and Black music worldwide. The primary audience and contributors were from the United
  States, although several pieces were submitted from around the world. The publication
  originally held four sections: research news; foundation news; questions and answers;
  and announcement.  This archive, part of the Black Music Research Center at Columbia
  College Chicago includes copies of every issue published between 1977 and 1990.'
