desription: True Echoes is an academic research project that aims to reconnect early
  sound recordings from digitised wax cylinders held in the British Library Sound
  Archive with the communities from which they originate in Oceanic cultures. The
  recordings in the collection were made in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu,
  New Caledonia and the Torres Strait Islands in Australia between 1898 and 1924 and
  contain early documentation of oral traditions as well as some of the earliest uses
  of sound in anthropological research. They include music, stories, speeches and
  many different types of songs; from hunting songs to hymns, lullabies to funeral
  dirges. The website includes access to the cylinder collections alongside historical
  context and modern participatory research with and within communities that showcases
  the legacies of the traditions captured in early wax cylinders.
