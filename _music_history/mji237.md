desription: Archival project led by singer, songwriter, and producer Holly Near dedicated
  to the movement known as 'Women's Music' which was centered around Oakland, CA,
  and sought to reflect "back to the audience women as real people—an honest, authentic
  expression of woman identification—how women saw themselves as feminists and lesbian
  feminists—something they had not been able to do in the mainstream music industry
  at that time." The website features a collection of video interviews with artists
  involved in the movement, playlists and music, photo gallery, and bibliographic
  references. Many of the video conversations are also available with American Sign
  Language interpretation.
