desription: The Berkeley Folk Music Festival & the Folk Revival on the US West Coastâ€”An
  Introduction is a digital exhibit that presents the story of the Berkeley Folk Music
  Festival, which took place on the campus of the University of California between
  1958 and 1970. The Exhibit was curated from the Berkeley Folk Music Festival Archive,
  a repository of roughly 33,500 artifacts housed at Northwestern University Libraries
  and now fully digitized through a National Endowment for the Humanities Preservation
  and Access Grant. Much of the Berkeley Archive has never been seen or heard before
  publicly. The website gives access to both the digital exhibition and the archive,
  which is primarily made up of images with some audio and video.
