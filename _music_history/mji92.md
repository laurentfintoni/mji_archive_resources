desription: The Black Music History Library is a collection of books, articles, documentaries,
  series, podcasts and more. The collection spans a wide range of genres starting
  in the 1800s through present day focusing on an expanded view of Black music. The
  stated mission of The Black Music History library is to “address any instances in
  which Black participation led to the creation or innovation of music across the
  diaspora” to reframe Black music as fundamental to the development of American,
  Latinx, and popular music as we know them today. The site is broken down by genre.
  Each section is further organized chronologically with resources of particular note
  labeled with a star and resources with Black authors highlighted. Aside from the
  collection itself, the site contains directories of Black music journalists, music
  scholars, and additional relevant websites.
