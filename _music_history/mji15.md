desription: Delia Derbyshire was a composer of early electronic music in the UK. This
  archive contains 267 audio tapes that have been digitized and are available to listen
  to at the library, including make-up tapes (uncovering the process of how Delia
  made her music) and recordings from radio and albums by the likes of Art Blakey,
  Karlheinz Stockhausen, Yusef Lateef and Can. The tapes are largely related to Derbyshire’s
  freelance projects as most of her work for the BBC is kept in the BBC Archive Centre
  at Perivale. There are also film donations from Madelon Hooykaas, an audio interview
  with Delia from Jo Hutton and a 90 second demo cue for an unmade film from the early
  1980s donated by the visual artist Elisabeth Kozmian. The physical items include
  books (about music and electronic music), working notes, correspondence and letters
  referring to Delia’s work, sound cue sheets, interview transcriptions and newspaper
  cuttings as well as childhood school notebooks and drawings.
