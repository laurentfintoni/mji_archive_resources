desription: The EMI Group of companies gifted much of their assets which originated
  before 1947 to the Trust. The purpose of the Trust is “the advancement of education
  and research and, in particular, to foster and promote the study and appreciation
  of the art techniques and development of sound recording and the history of the
  sound recording industry”. The collections start with the early recorded music industry
  and the role that EMI (originally The Gramophone Company) played in the emerging
  industry’s development and globalisation, from 1897 through to 1946.
