desription: Founded in 1955, The Village Voice is heralded as the first alt-weekly
  newspaper in America. Alt-weeklies that followed mimicked the form of The Village
  Voice in its focus on local cultural coverage and progressive stances on LGBT rights,
  politics, and real estate development, to name a few. The Village Voice was published
  until 2017 when it took a hiatus until 2021 under new ownership as a quarterly publication.
  This archive includes a majority of the early issues and sporadic issues over the
  newspaperâ€™s lifespan.
