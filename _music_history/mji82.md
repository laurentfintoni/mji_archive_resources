desription: Initially self-described as “America’s Only British Music Magazine,” Trouser
  Press was a New York-based music magazine that focused on the growing British, and
  later American, rock and punk scenes. In 1983, Trouser Press published the first
  Trouser Press Record Guide. They would go on to publish five lengthy books of album
  reviews over the following 15 years. In 2020, Trouser Press relaunched as an online
  publication. This archive includes all 95 print issues of Trouser Press from 1974
  to its closure in 1984 and a description of how each cover came to be, as well as
  anything particularly notable inside.
