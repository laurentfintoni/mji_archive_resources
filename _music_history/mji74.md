desription: DownBeat is a music magazine focused on “blues, jazz, and beyond” established
  in 1934 in Chicago, Illinois. This archive was established in March of 2021 and
  currently contains microfilm scans of issues from 1937 to 1961. DownBeat features
  extensive news, reviews, and interviews as well as annual readers’ and critics’
  polls. Winners of both polls make up the DownBeat Jazz Hall of Fame. Despite being
  listed on the Internet Archive as Down Beat 1937-2014, the archive currently spans
  all issues from 1937 to 1961 with additional recent issues from the 2000s and 2010s
  available via the magazine’s website.
