desription: "Map Pointz is a community-generated archive dedicated to the 90s L.A.
  backyard parties, rave and underground scene. It exists primarily on Instagram and
  is curated by Guadalupe Rosales, a multidisciplinary artist who also runs another,
  similar, archival project, “Veteranas and Rucas,” dedicated to Latinx women. The
  projects manifested in 2015 from the under/misrepresentation and historical erasure
  of Latinx communities in Southern California. These community-generated projects
  begin with an open invitation to various Latino communities to share personal images
  and memories that create visual narratives that celebrate identities and historicize
  subcultures. The archives explore ideas about how history and culture are framed
  and who does the framing.  \n\nGuadalupe’s studio also houses and preserves a physical
  archive of Chicano/Latino ephemera from the 1970s to the late-1990s, including but
  not limited to magazines, prison art and letters, posters and flyers from the Los
  Angeles underground backyard-party and rave scenes of the 1990s."
