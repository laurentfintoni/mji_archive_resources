desription: DRAM is a not-for-profit resource providing educational communities with
  on-demand streaming access to CD-quality audio (192kbps Mp4), complete original
  liner notes and essays from independent record labels and sound archives. Continuing
  in the tradition of DRAM's sister company New World Records, the primary focus is
  the preservation and dissemination of important recordings that have been neglected
  by the commercial marketplace, recordings that may otherwise become lost or forgotten.
  The touchstone of the DRAM collection is the diverse catalogue of American music
  represented by the New World Records and CRI label(s), which merged in 2007. From
  folk to opera, Native American to jazz, 19th century classical to early rock, musical
  theater, contemporary, electronic and beyond, New World has served composers, artists,
  students and the general public since its inception in 1975 with a grant from the
  Rockefeller Foundation. The acquisition of CRI deepened its catalog of contemporary
  American composition and restored to circulation recordings that had, in some cases,
  been out of print for decades. DRAM also includes music from a growing number of
  recording labels and archives. More than 4,000 albums' worth of recordings from
  a distinctive set of 42 independent labels and archives are now available, with
  new content being continuously added.
