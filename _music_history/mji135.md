desription: Much of South Africaâ€™s music heritage, like that of our political past,
  is hard to access. Just as people and books were banned and censored, so too was
  music, sometimes along with the musicians who made it. Much of the material recorded
  was politically sensitive, or subversive; some of it was never commercially released,
  and has remained hidden, even forgotten. Troves of local recorded music await identification,
  digitisation and research. The South African Music Archive Project aims to create
  an online resource on South African music and associated cultural heritage, so as
  to promote multidisciplinary research in the field of popular music and culture.
  This site currently contains approximately 13,000 audio samples and associated metadata
  from 5 music collections alongside additional projects covering folk music from
  across the African continent, found sounds, and modern music.
