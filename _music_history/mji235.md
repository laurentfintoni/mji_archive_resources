desription: Streetsound was a Canadian monthly music magazine that began publication
  in 1985 and ended in 1998 after 91 issues. It started out as a tip sheet for Starsound
  Records, a record store owned by Ahmad and Sepehr Azari in Toronto, before expanding
  into a magazine under Michael Mannix and Sylvie Falar, who worked at Canadian pop
  culture magazine Graffiti. While Streetsound's tagline set it as a dance music/DJ
  authority, first for Canada and then North America, it also covered other genres
  including hip-hop, rock, reggae, and sould music. In 1992, Streetsound bought the
  trade weekly Dance Music Report and a year later it moved to NYC. In 1995, the magazine
  launched its website becoming one of the earliest publications to have a presence
  in the growing online communities around hip-hop and dance music. This online involvement
  took a further turn a couple years later when Pseudo.com, an early streaming service,
  acquired Streetsound and g\ave it a dedicated channel. The Streetsound online archive
  features a selection of issues, which can be read on issuu or downloaded as PDFs,
  as well as a selection of videos from the Pseudo.com era.
