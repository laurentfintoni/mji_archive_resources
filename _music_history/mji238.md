desription: Established by American Studies Ph.D. Kevin Kosanovich, the William &
  Mary Hip Hop Collection is the most comprehensive of its kind dedicated to Virginia’s
  hip hop culture and history from the 1980s to the present. The collection includes
  oral histories committed to preserving and documenting Virginia’s rich hip hop past,
  as well as recordings of hip hop music, publications, and ephemera created by Virginia
  and Virginia-based artists, collectives, and businesses. Additionally, the collection
  documents the origins and impact of hip hop culture on college campuses throughout
  the state by collecting records of hip hop based student organizations, college
  radio stations, events and concerts with a special focus on William & Mary itself.
  The collection is being digitized with a majority of oral histories available alongside
  photographs, record covers and flyers, and to a lesser extent written documents.
