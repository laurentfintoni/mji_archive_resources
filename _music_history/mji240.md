desription: Creem was launched in Detroit in 1969 by Barry Kramer and Tony Reay as
  a rock ‘n’ roll magazine dedicated to raucous, participatory journalism. In the
  two decades it remained active the magazine became notorious for its unfiltered
  coverage, made famous by its editor Lester Bangs. The magazine closed in 1989 and
  following a brief period as a tabloid in the 1990s was relaunched in 2022 as a digital
  archive with a new quarterly print edition led by JJ Kramer, son of Barry Kramer.
  Access to both the archive and the new online content requires a subscription.
