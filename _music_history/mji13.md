desription: The Bob Moog Foundation Archive is an extensive, historically rich and
  culturally significant body of materials representing 50 years of pioneering efforts
  in electronic music. The archive currently includes vintage instruments, prototypes,
  photographs, schematics, and items from Bob Moogâ€™s extensive career. The archive
  is not currently open to the public and only operates via collaborations, some of
  which are documented on the website. Plans are undergoing for a museum that could
  house the archive in Ashville, NC.
