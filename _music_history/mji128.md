desription: "Blogariddims was a fortnightly inter-blog podcast started in June 2006,
  “with the aim of showcasing the high level and variety of selecting, mixing and
  writing talent in the small corner of the music blogosphere inhabited by nuumskulls,
  faded-junglists, genre-nerds and bass addicts of every stripe.” The series was “overseen”
  by Weareie and Paul Autonomic and ran until 2008 when it ended at the 50th episode.
  Contributors included journalists, DJs, producers, and bloggers such as Wayne Marshall,
  The Heatwave, John Eden, Grievous Angel, Dan Hancox and Bok Bok, and Zhao covering
  everything from the genealogy of Crunk to the evolution of UK MCs via Norwegian
  post-punk, late 2000s grime, ragga, baile funk and much more. \n\nThe entire series
  is archived in a blog post that includes links to the written accompaniment for
  every entry. Each episode can be downloaded directly via Feedburner."
