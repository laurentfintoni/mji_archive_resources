desription: Go-Go is a style of funk that originated in Washington D.C. in the 1970s.
  Known for heavy bass, driving percussion and call-and-response, the genre has become
  one of the most popular music forms in the city. In memory of music icon Chuck Brown,
  the DC Public Library established a Go-Go Archive in 2012 to honor, preserve, teach
  and enjoy DC's original music. The Go-Go Archive captures both well-documented and
  lesser-known stories from organizations, record labels, houses, venues, festivals,
  record shops, radio stations and artists. Currently, the Library has more than 20
  linear feet of materials in various formats including photographs, books, magazines,
  records, cassettes, CDs, DVDs and video.
