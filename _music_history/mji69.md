desription: Originally founded in 1999, Faith ran for 13 years as a publication dedicated
  to house music. Beyond the fanzine, Faith also threw and promoted club nights that
  purported to not be a superclub, not have any corporate sponsorship, and not have
  DJs that travel in jets. In 2020, it was announced Faith would return as a physical
  magazine in partnership with London house label Defected. The Faith archive has
  digital copies of all issues from 1999 up to the revival of the fanzine. There is
  also an events directory, playlists, their radio program, and music released under
  their record label imprint.
