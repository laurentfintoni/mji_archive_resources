desription: The Great American Songbook Archives & Library exists to preserve the
  physical artifacts of the Songbook so that current and future generations can experience
  them. It is the only facility dedicated to preserving the Great American Songbook.
  The Great American Songbook Foundation Library and Archives was created in 2008
  with the receipt of the Gus Kahn and Donald Kahn Collections. Since that date, it
  has expanded to include the collections of Hy Zaret, Meredith Willson, Ray Charles
  (the arranger) and numerous others. Library collections include LPs donated by Will
  Friedwald and Didier Deutsch, as well as books, CDs, DVDs and more. The library
  and archives works to serve the teaching and research needs of its user communities
  by collecting as comprehensively as possible those materials that have enduring
  value to documenting the history of American popular music.
