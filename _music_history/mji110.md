desription: SixtyEight2OhFive is a playlist archive and essay series helmed by poet
  and author, Hanif Abdurraqib. The playlist project started as an exploration in
  defining the “family tree” of the music that has informed Abdurraqib’s musical influences
  spanning the years 1968 to 2005. SixtyEight2OhFive has an accompanying essay series
  where a wide range of writers and musicians discuss an album from the range of years
  that changed their lives. Each year’s page in the playlist archive provides a Spotify
  playlist, Abdurraqib’s favorite albums, a gallery of magazine covers, and videos
  of notable live performances.
