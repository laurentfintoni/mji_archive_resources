desription: 'What does religion in the United States sound like? This question animates
  the American Religious Sounds Project (ARSP), a collaborative research initiative
  co-directed by Amy DeRogatis (Michigan State University) and Isaac Weiner (Ohio
  State University), which aims to offer new resources for documenting and interpreting
  the diversity of American religious life by attending to its varied sonic cultures.
  To date, the Project has centered on: (1) the construction of a unique sonic archive,
  documenting the diversity of everyday religious life through newly produced field
  recordings, interviews, oral histories, and related materials; and (2) the development
  of a digital platform and website, which draws on materials in our archive to engage
  users in telling new stories about religious diversity in the U.S.'
