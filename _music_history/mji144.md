desription: An archive of James Hamiltonâ€™s columns in Record Mirror, from 1975 onwards.
  The columns were first transcribed by Shootyourshot, from copies of Record Mirror
  held on microfilm at the New York Public Library, and originally posted on the now
  defunct forums at discomusic.com. The Record Mirror disco column began on September
  21, 1974. Its disco chart started out with 10 places, and expanded to 20 on December
  7. James Hamilton took over the column on June 28, 1975. Copies of the column and
  chart have been made up to the end of 1990. All available columns and charts can
  be read and browsed on this blog, setup in chronological order alongside image scans,
  additional historical information, and chart compilations.
