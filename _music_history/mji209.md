desription: MBC seeks to inspire Black students by showing them that “they are an
  integral part of classical music’s past as well as its future” and to bring greater
  diversity to the world of classical music. It does this by making music by Black
  composers available to all, via sheet music collections, as well as offering various
  free resources including directories of living and historic Black composers, discography,
  and bibliography.
