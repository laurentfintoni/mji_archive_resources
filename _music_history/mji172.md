desription: CHARM was established to promote a musicology that better reflects the
  nature of music as experienced in the twentieth century and beyond by not limiting
  its approach to music as a written text reproduced by performance only. CHARM includes
  an online discography and library of ex-copyright recordings and campaigns for the
  extension of fair dealing to include sound recordings, and against extension of
  the copyright term on sound recordings. Alongside the discography, the website includes
  almost 5,000 sound files transferred from 78rpm discs held by the King's Sound Archive
  at King's College London. Apart from a special focus on Schubert songs, the CHARM
  transfers aimed to cover a broad range of performers in Classical repertoire, avoiding
  where possible tracks that were already widely available in CD or online reissues.
