desription: Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) is one of the few cultural institutions
  in Brooklyn that maintains an oral history program.  Begun in 1973, BHSâ€™s oral history
  collections now include over 1,200 interviews. The collections provide a wealth
  of historical evidence about the lives of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century
  Brooklyn residents, and reveal how diverse individuals and communities have sought
  to preserve vital social, political, religious, and cultural traditions as Brooklynites,
  New Yorkers, and Americans. The collections contain interviews conducted in English,
  Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin, with narrators born as early as 1880.
