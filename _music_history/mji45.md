desription: Established by the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in
  1992, the Jazz Oral History Program documented more than one hundred senior jazz
  musicians, performers, relatives, and business associates. Each interview was conducted
  by a jazz authority and was recorded on digital audiotape by a professional audio
  engineer. The interviews average six hours in length and cover a wide range of topics
  including early years, initial involvement in music, generally, and jazz specifically,
  as well as experiences in the jazz music world, including relationships to musicians.
