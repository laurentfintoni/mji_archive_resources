  The ARChive of Contemporary Music (ARC) is a not-for-profit archive, music library and research center located in New York City since 1985. ARC contains more than three million sound recordings. They preserve copies of each version of every recording, in all known formats, and have electronically catalogued more than 400,000 sound recordings and digitized 200,000 with their partners the Internet Archive – more than any other public, university or private library in America. ARC also houses more than three million pieces of attendant support material including photographs, videos, DVDs, books, magazines, press kits, sheet music, ephemera and memorabilia. The ARC website features extensive catalogues of its holdings while the Internet Archive holds over 200,000 digitized items primarily audio as well as text.

  The ARChive website includes databases of catalogues including recordings, genres, books, instruments, and special collections. The Internet Archive contains digital copies of books and music from the ARChive. Some of the audio materials at the Internet Archive are limited in usage based on rights and some of the books are accessible via the IA’s lending system.
