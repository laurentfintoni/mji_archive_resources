desription: Founded in 1962, Broadside Magazine was instrumental in the folk-revival
  and served as a resource for political songwriters through the duration of its publication.
  The magazine had a stated mission of promoting as many “topical” and political songs
  as possible. Originally published bi-monthly through the late 70s, Broadside was
  revived in 1982 and ran until 1988. This archive encompasses all 186 issues of Broadside
  and is available through the website for folk music magazine Sing Out!
