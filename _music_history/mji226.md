desription: This digital collection consists of items related to the composition and
  publication of gospel music taken from the husband-and-wife team of Charles and
  Frankie Pace, who ran one of the earliest and most successful independent Black
  gospel music publishing businesses between the 1930s and 1980s. Charles composed,
  arranged, and printed his own music which was sold via their store in Pittsburgh
  and distributed nationally to a network of Black-owned stores. They also founded
  the Pace Gospel Choral Union and combined music and activism. This collection features
  over 70 images and other materials that represent the first step in the printing
  process as well as songbooks, business items, and photographs.
