desription: The Women of Rock Oral History Project is a collection of digital interviews
  and written transcripts housed at the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College,
  documenting the lives and careers of women in rock music, focusing primarily on
  artists who have been left out of the popular rock narrative. Started in 2014, by
  Tanya Pearson, the collection now consists of over 40 interviews. The projectâ€™s
  main initiative is to construct a more comprehensive history of rock music by creating
  a well publicized, diverse and accessible collection of personal histories. The
  website includes full video interviews and transcripts are available via the Sophia
  Smith Collection.
