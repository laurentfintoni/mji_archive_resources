desription: Founded in 1976 at the beginning of a military dictatorship that ruled
  over Argentina, El Expreso Imaginario was a magazine based around the music and
  progressive arts and culture of the country. With its signature illustrated covers,
  the magazine focused on covering the growing rock scene in Argentina and other similarly
  occupied South American countries alongside the greater American and British scenes.
  Due to the heavy censorship of the time, El Expreso Imaginario is remembered as
  much for providing an alternative, progressive point of view as it is for music
  coverage. This archive provides PDF copies of all 78 issues of El Expreso Imaginario,
  ranging from 1976 to 1983, as well as an extensive history of the magazine, the
  people who made it, and the atmosphere of Argentina at the time.
