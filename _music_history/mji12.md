desription: Bass Culture is the first Arts and Humanities Research Council award to
  the Black Music Research Unit at the University of Westminster. It takes the form
  of a three-year academic research project exploring the impact of Jamaican and Jamaican-influenced
  music on British culture. Covering the period from the 1960s to the present day,
  with an initial focus on London and a particular interest in the years 1976 – 1981,
  the research explores the profound ways in which the island’s music remade popular
  music in Britain – and was fundamental in the redefinition of the post-colonial
  nation. The online archive includes a selection of full and partial interviews and
  images from the research.
