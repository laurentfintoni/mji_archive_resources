desription: The Loeb Music Library’s collection of early disc recordings of Arab and
  Arab-American music spans the first half of the twentieth century, roughly 1903
  through the 1950s. The Arabic 78 Collection currently contains nearly 600 cataloged
  recordings, many made by large multi-national American and European record companies
  (Gramophone Company, Columbia, Victor and Odeon) as well as some by significant
  local companies such as Baidaphon (the first independent record label in the Arab
  world) and Fabrik Mechian alongside Maloof and Macksoud from the US. The collection
  also includes discs issued on early pirate labels like Opera Disc Company and later
  Arab-American record labels such as Alamphon, Arabphon and Al-Chark. Genres cover
  a wide range of Arab musical forms including al-mawwāl (vocal improvisation), qaṣīdah
  (sung poems), taqsīm (instrumental improvisation), film music, ṭaqṭūqah (pop songs)
  and Qur’anic recitations. Recordings deemed to have been released before December
  31, 1922 can be streamed and downloaded.
