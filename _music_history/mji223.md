  in America. It began as a local publication, working with radio station KGFJ, before
  expanding nationally and going on to feature many of the most famous artists of
  the era on its cover. Its run remains one of the most important record of the lives
  and stories of Black artists during the 60s and 70s, The website offers yearly or
  monthly subscriptions for access to the digital archives, featuring a digital reading
  interface, new issues added regularly, and audio recordings.
