desription: A collaboration between Honey Pot Performance, the Modern Dance Music
  Research and Archiving Foundation, the Blackivists, and a team of local cultural
  historians and cultural producers, the Chicago Black Social Map exists to preserve
  Chicago's black social cultural lineage - past, present, and future - through an
  experience that is both fun and informative. The CBSCM archive includes information
  centered around social venues, including basic geo-spatial information, first-person
  stories, and supplemental media, all collected through collaborative community research.
  Drawing from blues, gospel, disco, and funk as well as dances such as bopping, stepping,
  and line dances, the archive explores an evolving embodied lineage of African American
  forms of making community and of cultural resistance.
