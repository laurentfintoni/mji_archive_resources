desription: Originally focusing on Sound Poetry proper, UbuWeb's Sound section has
  grown to encompass all types of sound art, historical and contemporary. Beginning
  with pioneers such as Guillaume Apollinaire reading his "Calligrammes" in 1913,
  and proceeding to current practitioners such as Vito Acconci or Kristin Oppenheim,
  UbuWeb Sound surveys the entire 20th century and beyond. Categories include Dadaism,
  Futurism, early 20th century literary experiments, musique concrete, electronic
  music, Fluxus, Beat sound works, minimalist and process works, performance art,
  plunderphonics and sampling, and digital glitch works, to name just a few.
