desription: The mission of the Cornell Hip Hop Collection (CHHC) is to collect and
  make accessible the historical artifacts of hip-hop culture and to ensure their

  than 250,000 items across dozens of archives documenting the origins of hip-hop
  culture and its spread around the globe. Located in Cornell Library’s Division of
  Rare and Manuscript Collections, the archives include thousands of sound and video
  recordings, hundreds of party and event flyers, artwork, photographs, books, magazines,
  and advertising, along with the archives of photographers, filmmakers, dancers,
  MC’s, DJ’s, artists, journalists, producers and publicists, and independent labels,
  managers and agencies. The physical archive is open to the public.
