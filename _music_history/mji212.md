desription: Sounding Spirit is a pilot digital library that brings together songbooks
  and hymnals published across the southern United States from 1850 to 1925, and which
  are historically underrepresented in archival holdings and scholarship. Taken from
  four partner archives, the songbooks demonstrate the variety of “form, content,
  and presentation in southern vernacular sacred publishing.” They also include different
  approaches to notation and showcase a variety of musical styles “from dispersed
  harmony fuging tunes and plain tunes of the shape-note repertoire, to antiphonal
  gospel, to classically inspired arrangements of African American spirituals, to
  words-only hymns in Muskokee sung in unison, to tunes in oral tradition shared among
  southern black and white congregations.” The website offers access to the texts
  via the Readux platform which enables browsing and annotation (the latter requires
  logging). Historical information and context for each songbook is also given. Annotations
  can be downloaded for external uses.
