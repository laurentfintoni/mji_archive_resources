desription: The Black Gospel Music Preservation Program (BGMPP) aims to identify,
  acquire, preserve, record and catalogue the most at-risk music from the black gospel
  music tradition. It is centered around the Royce-Darden Collection, held at Baylor
  University, and primarily contains 78s, 45s, LPs, and the various tape formats issued
  in the United States and abroad between the 40s and the 80s. Additionally, any ephemera
  that may be of use to scholars – including PR photos and press packets, taped interviews,
  informal photographs, tour books and programs, newspaper and magazine clippings,
  and sheet music – is also acquired as it becomes available. A digital version of
  the collection, with around 9,000 items, is available featuring audio and images
  as well as metadata.
