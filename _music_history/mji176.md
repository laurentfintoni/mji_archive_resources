desription: Sonic Street Technologies is a European Research Council funded research
  project (2021 â€“ 2025) examining the role and value of bottom up, subaltern and Global
  South uses of recorded music technologies. The project aims to map the distribution
  and history of these SST worldwide; to investigate the social, economic and cultural
  conditions from which they are born; and to achieve a deeper understanding of the
  nature of technology itself and its uses for social and economic progress. SST adopts
  a practice-as-research methodology as a respect for the knowledge embodied in current
  sound system and similar street cultures and to help build capacities for their
  autonomous development. The website currently includes a regularly updated blog,
  readings and movie lists, and a sonic map.
