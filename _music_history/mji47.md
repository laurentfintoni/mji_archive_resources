desription: For 15 years, Queer Music Heritage ran as a radio show and accompanying
  website by JD Doyle. After the end of the radio show in 2015, the website has lived
  on as a history of LGBT music. Main sections of the website, beyond the full archive
  of radio shows, concern gay musicals, drag artist directory and memorabilia, womenâ€™s
  music, camp songs, Stonewall songs, gay ephemera, and more. Doyle is also behind
  Houston LGBT History, a website that began as a section of Queer Music Heritage
  that has grown outside music into other aspects of LGBT focused politics and culture
  in Houston, Texas. Houston LGBT History also features a huge number of national
  and regional publications regarding LGBT culture, like This Week in Texas and a
  chronological directory of early national gay publications, reaching back over 50
  years. All of these publications can be downloaded from the website.
