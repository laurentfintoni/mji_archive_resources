desription: 'This collection consists of over 30 hours of 7" open reel-to-reel master
  tapes, compact discs (DVDs), and transcripts for oral histories documenting the
  invention and development of the analogue music synthesizer. The Jerome and Dorothy
  Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, in cooperation with Trevor
  Pinch and Frank Trocco of Cornell University, conducted oral histories to document
  the pioneering engineers and musicians of the electronic music synthesizer from
  1960 to 1970. Pinch and Trocco authored Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of
  the Moog Synthesizer by Harvard University Press in 2002. This book is based on
  the oral histories from the Analogue Music Synthesizer Oral History Project.'
