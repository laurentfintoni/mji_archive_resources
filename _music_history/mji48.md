desription: Hot Wire was a Chicago based magazine published from 1984 to 1994. Though
  always women and feminism focused, Hot Wire was mainly dedicated to lesbian culture
  at a time when the word was greatly maligned. The magazine captured a wide range
  of lesbian culture through interviews, festival and album reviews, and recurring
  columns and comics from people who would grow into important figures in feminist
  culture like Alison Bechdel. Alongside a full PDF archive of all 30 issues of Hot
  Wire, the website also features directories of links to women’s music and other
  women’s culture archives. Hot Wire has also published special newsletters of updates
  on what “longtime friends” of the publication have been doing since it ceased operation.
